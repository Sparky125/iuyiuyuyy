Terminology
Performance Component - a description of what the student knows and can do about a coherent set of networking knowledge and skills; the level at which the student's work product can be assigned a proficiency estimate.

Proficiency Estimate - a description of a student's level of mastery of the performance component. The proficiency estimate is not meant to be a comprehensive statement of what the student knows and can do.

Work Product - student performance recorded during this assessment. For example, the submitted activity file, timing statistics, and final running configurations.

Work Product Feature - An aspect of the student's work product. The feature can have a name and a value. For example, Name = FastEthernet0/0:IP Address; Value = 192.168.1.1

Individual work product features are combined into performance components and scored based on the complexity of the performance observed. Because the construction of performance components is based on the underlying work product features as well as the unique design of each scenario, strict boundaries for determining a proficiency rating are not possible. In general:

None - 0% to 25% of possible points
Novice - 26% to 50% of possible points
Partial - 51% to 85% of possible points
Proficient - 86% to 100% of possible points
